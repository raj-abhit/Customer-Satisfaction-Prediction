# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction
# üìò Introduction
Customer satisfaction is crucial for business success and customer retention. However, challenges like inconsistent service quality, poor customer experiences, and inadequate feedback systems often hinder optimal customer relationships. This project introduces an AI-powered customer satisfaction prediction system designed to forecast customer satisfaction levels based on various service and interaction metrics.

Unlike traditional analytical methods, this system utilizes machine learning classification models. These models are particularly effective at recognizing patterns and complex relationships in customer data, making them ideal for this application.

# üéØ Objectives
Predict customer satisfaction levels based on input features: Service quality metrics, response times, customer demographics, interaction history, and feedback scores.

Train and evaluate multiple classification models to predict satisfaction categories from predefined levels.

Analyze the model's performance using standard classification metrics:

‚úÖ Accuracy
‚úÖ Precision
‚úÖ Recall
‚úÖ F1-score
‚úÖ Confusion Matrix

This system aims to empower businesses and customer service teams with data-driven insights, leading to improved customer experiences and fostering long-term customer relationships.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Numpy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

# üìä Model Evaluation
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using standard classification metrics, which may include:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
